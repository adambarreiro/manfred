    "desiredJobDescription": "My ideal job would allow me to contribute to a product or service that's truly innovative and has a meaningful impact on customers' lives, whether in eCommerce solutions or more technical domains like virtualization or cloud technologies.\n\nI'd love to work for a company that embraces a fully asynchronous and remote-first mindset, with rich, well-maintained documentation, minimal micromanagement, and a culture that avoids unnecessary meetings and, above all, trusts its employees.\n\nThroughout my career, I've worked primarily as an individual contributor, but I've also had the opportunity to mentor others (something I genuinely enjoy).",
    "goodPractices": "**Technical skills**\n\nI strive to apply clean-code principles whenever they genuinely add value. I work with TDD, DDD, SOLID, KISS and many other \"fancy\" acronyms, but ultimately I see them as tools for achieving a balanced trade-off between maintainability, performance and readability. For me, good engineering is about common sense and choosing the right approach for the problem at hand.\n\n**Soft skills**\n\nHaving spent the last years working fully remotely, I’ve developed strong asynchronous-communication habits:\n\n- I avoid ad-hoc or unnecessary meetings whenever possible, if something can be an email (or a message), it should be.\n\n- I write clear and meaningful messages in Slack-like tools. Starting a conversation with a simple \"Hi\" and waiting is usually counterproductive (see [https://nohello.net](https://nohello.net))\n\n- I maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation: README files, technical notes, Confluence pages, and anything needed to keep the team aligned.",
